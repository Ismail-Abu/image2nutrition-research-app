# image2nutrition-research-app
A mobile app that analyzes food images and breaks down nutritional content into RAG/SAG categories for protein, fats, and calories. This is built for research and usability.

## Overview

This project explores whether it's possible to accurately break down a food image into its nutritional facts using image recognition. The app allows users to take a photo of their meal and receive a breakdown of macronutrients categorized by RAG/SAG levels. It's designed as both a research tool and a user-friendly prototype.

## Research Goal

We aim to evalate:
The accuracy of food identification from images
The reliability of macronutrient estimation (protein, fats, calories)
The effectiveness of RAG/SAG categorization for nutritional insight
The usability of the app interface across diverse users and meals

## Prototype Data Repo

We’re using a separate private repo to keep track of all the data and examples from other apps and projects that are helping us build this one. 
It’s basically a space to collect anything useful — datasets, scripts, and notes about them, that push the app forward faster.

 https://github.com/Ismail-Abu/image2nutrition-research-data*(private)*

This includes stuff like:
Datasets we’re testing 
Scripts from other nutrition tools
Notes on what we’re keeping, changing, or remixing

Only our team can see it for now, but it’s helping shape how the app works.
