# image2nutrition-research-app
A mobile app that analyzes food images and breaks down nutritional content into RAG/SAG categories for protein, fats, and calories. This is built for research and usability.

## Overview

This project explores whether it's possible to accurately break down a food image into its nutritional facts using image recognition. The app allows users to take a photo of their meal and receive a breakdown of macronutrients categorized by RAG/SAG levels. It's designed as both a research tool and a user-friendly prototype.

## Research Goal

We aim to evaluate:
The accuracy of food identification from images
The reliability of macronutrient estimation (protein, fats, calories)
The effectiveness of RAG/SAG categorization for nutritional insight
The usability of the app interface across diverse users and meals
